The flower of the week is the humble Chrysanthemum. The reason I'm calling them humble is because they are often overlooked for their simplicity and for being readily available. They have such a relaxed feel about them.

We have so many colours in store right now- pink, mauve, white, green, yellow, rust and burgundy.  Leading up to Mother's Day, this traditional "Mum" flower comes in a wide range of colours and shapes.

There are standard Chryssies, spray Chryssies, spider Chryssies and Pom-pom Chryssies.  Standard Chryssies are used as a feature flower in bouquets and the sprays tend to be used more as a "backup" flower, much like a support act in a musical group. Chryssies are great for their longevity and as a colourful and joyful addition to an arrangement.  Chrysanthemums are reminiscent of daisies and give the sense of being cut from a home-grown garden, which allows for a more relaxed feel in a bouquet. They are also available for much of the year which means they are a staple in the florist's repertoire.
